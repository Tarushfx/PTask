# PTask

The task manager your pet will love  
'Cause it will save time

Another Task Manager? Aren't there like a million of those?  
**Yes!**
There are a lot of them. But none like PTask.

## Why PTask?

**Productivity**: Who doesn't waant to be efficient in today's world?
We were annoyed of using multiple task managers to keep track of different things in our lives which wasted a lot of time juggling from one app to another.
Hence we built Ptask to solve the problem with a bunch of other features which were not available in popular manager apps.

PTask offers you with all the features that one expects from a task manager.

1. **Managing Tasks**: A simple, interactive and beautiful UI
2. **Notifications**: Excellent notification system to keep you on track
3. **Flawless Networking**: Connect with your team members with our in-app chatting.
4. **Quotes**: To keep you motivated!

Technologies Used:

- **Stack**: MERN-GraphQL
- **Chat**: Web-Sockets + GraphQL-Yoga
- **Notifications**: Toastify
- **UI inspiration**: [True Coder](https://www.youtube.com/c/TrueCoder)
